## The Why

=== Recently ===, I came to the conclusion that despite my best efforts, keeping my website up to date was difficult. It was a collection of old code that I wrote in highschool using a _very cool_ Windows 98:tm: CSS theme.

## This Post

As you can probably guess, this post is mostly a test of the features and styling of this website. This won't be a guide by any means, but rather I decided to write this post for three reasons:

1. To see how numbered markdown lists look (the answer is _very good_)
2. To document what I've done in creating this site and theme - this will be helpful when I inevitably have someone ask how to make a static site like mine.
3. To actually test run the pipeline from having a blog post idea to seeing it on my website.

## The Old and The Ugly

As I mentioned, my old site was a site to behold. Leaning into the vaporwave aesthetic was great, but could have been pulled of a bit better. This section will be a post-mortem of my old website
